            <p class="">Rebel Poet</p>
            <p class="">Kazi Nazrul Islam (b. May 25, 1899 — d. August 29, 1976) was a Bengali poet, musician,
                revolutionary and philosopher who is best known for pioneering works of Bengali poetry. He is popularly
                known as the Bidrohi Kobi — Rebel Poet — as many of his works showcase an intense rebellion against
                oppression of humans through slavery, hatred and tradition. He is officially recognised as the national
                poet of Bangladesh and commemorated in India. </p>
