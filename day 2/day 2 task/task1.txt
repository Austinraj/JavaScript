differance bettween document and window object:

    What is a JavaScript window?

The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. 
It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of 
the Document object model(DOM)

What is a JavaScript document?

A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document 
object for manipulation inside the document.

Syntax:

window object:
        window.propertyname;
document object:
        document.propertyname
                // OR
        window.document.propertyname
