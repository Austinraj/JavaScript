  Of course, let's incorporate the aspects of photography, venue, and pricing into your project description for the
  interview:

  "In our Event Management System, we've integrated a range of features to enhance the event planning experience. Along
  with the core functionalities, we've included a few more key elements that set our system apart.

  One of the standout features is the option for event organizers to select professional photography services. When
  creating an event, they can choose from a list of trusted photographers who can capture the memorable moments. This
  ensures that events are not only well-organized but also beautifully documented.

  Additionally, our system offers a venue management module, allowing event organizers to search and reserve suitable
  venues with ease. We've partnered with various venues, and our system provides detailed information on each venue,
  such as capacity, facilities, and pricing. Event organizers can compare venues, book their preferred location, and
  even visualize the setup using our virtual venue planning tools.

  Speaking of pricing, we've designed the system to provide a transparent and flexible pricing structure. Event
  organizers can easily calculate the cost of hosting their event, taking into account factors like venue fees,
  photography services, and other additional features. This transparency fosters trust and helps organizers make
  informed decisions.

  By integrating photography, venue management, and pricing, our Event Management System aims to be a comprehensive
  solution that simplifies the entire event planning process while offering a delightful experience for both event
  organizers and customers."
