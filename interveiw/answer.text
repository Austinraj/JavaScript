  "In my project, I developed an Event Management System, which is a web-based application. The frontend of the system
  is built using Java, which provides a user-friendly interface for both Admin and Customer users. The backend is
  powered by MySQL, serving as a reliable and scalable database to store all the data related to events and users.

  The system has two primary user roles: Admin and Customer. The Admin role allows users to manage and oversee all
  aspects of event management. They can create, update, and delete events, manage customer data, and handle event
  logistics. On the other hand, the Customer role is focused on user experience. Customers can browse and search for
  events, register for events they're interested in, and view their own event history.

  One of the key features of our system is its flexibility and ease of use. It streamlines the event management process,
  making it convenient for both event organizers and attendees. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into event
  performance, attendance, and customer preferences through data stored in the MySQL database.

  The combination of Java for the frontend and MySQL for the backend ensures a robust and responsive application that
  meets the needs of both the administrators and the end-users. Our project offers a comprehensive solution for event
  management, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to organize and participate in events efficiently."
