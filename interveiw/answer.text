is built using Java, which provides a user-friendly interface for both Admin and Customer users. The backend is
powered by MySQL, serving as a reliable and scalable database to store all the data related to events and users.

The system has two primary user roles: Admin and Customer. The Admin role allows users to manage and oversee all
aspects of event management. They can create, update, and delete events, manage customer data, and handle event
logistics. On the other hand, the Customer role is focused on user experience. Customers can browse and search for
events, register for events they're interested in, and view their own event history.

One of the key features of our system is its flexibility and ease of use. It streamlines the event management process,
making it convenient for both event organizers and attendees. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into event
performance, attendance, and customer preferences through data stored in the MySQL database.
making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to organize and participate in events efficiently.
 
The combination of Java for the frontend and MySQL for the backend ensures a robust and responsive application that
meets the needs of both the administrators and the end-users. Our project offers a comprehensive solution for event
management, making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to organize and participate in events efficiently."



  "In our Event Management System, we've integrated a range of features to enhance the event planning experience. Along
  with the core functionalities, we've included a few more key elements that set our system apart.

  One of the standout features is the option for event organizers to select professional photography services. When
  creating an event, they can choose from a list of trusted photographers who can capture the memorable moments. This
  ensures that events are not only well-organized but also beautifully documented.

  Additionally, our system offers a venue management module, allowing event organizers to search and reserve suitable
  venues with ease. We've partnered with various venues, and our system provides detailed information on each venue,
  such as capacity, facilities, and pricing. Event organizers can compare venues, book their preferred location, and
  even visualize the setup using our virtual venue planning tools.

  Speaking of pricing, we've designed the system to provide a transparent and flexible pricing structure. Event
  organizers can easily calculate the cost of hosting their event, taking into account factors like venue fees,
  photography services, and other additional features. This transparency fosters trust and helps organizers make
  informed decisions.

  By integrating photography, venue management, and pricing, our Event Management System aims to be a comprehensive
  solution that simplifies the entire event planning process while offering a delightful experience for both event
  organizers and customers."
