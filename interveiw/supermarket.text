"In my project, I developed a Supermarket Management System, which is a web-based application. The frontend of the system is built using HTML,CSS and Oracle APEX , which provides a user-friendly interface for both Admin and Customer users. The backend is powered by SQL and PL/SQL, serving as a reliable and scalable database to store all the data related to products and users.

The system has two primary user roles: Admin and Customer. The Admin role allows users to manage and oversee all
aspects of Supermarket management. They can create, update, and delete products, manage customer data, and handle product logistics. On the other hand, the Customer role is focused on user experience. Customers can browse and search for products, pouches for products they're interested in, and view their own pouches history.

One of the key features of our system is its flexibility and ease of use. It streamlines the supermarket management process, making it convenient for both stores owner and pouches users. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into stores reviwe and products reviwe through data stored in the SQL database.
making it a valuable tool for anyone looking to pouches in product efficiently.

<!-- What are Collections in APEX? Could you give some usage examples?  -->
Collections is a type of variable that can store multiple number of records. For example, List can store multiple number of Account object's records.
